# Quirk-CBT-app

In this app, I made a small contribution by uncommenting a few lines in the package.json. However with further coding knowledge, I would like to make a contribution to this app by adding a feature that helps with in the moment pyschological distress, such as panic attacks or anxiety attacks. A difficult part of rehabilitation and therapy is the moments when you relapse into the cycle and even though this app helps with the over time conditioning, it doesn't help with the in-the-moment situations when somebody is in distress at that moment with little to no resources for help. So it would be a great addition to the app if there could be some sort of panic button where someone experiencing an attack or difficult situation can get a sense of guided relief with a meditiation leading them out of the stressful situation. In a way, I am working towards this solution my self by creating an App, Tranquility, that allows people to access a panic button , designed to calm them down and lead their way out of the situation. If it could be added as a subsect of Quirk, it would not only be a viable addon to make the app more useful but it would also expand the demographic of the app, with people who have PTSD or panic attacks to use it.
